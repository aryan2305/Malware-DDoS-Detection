# Malware Detection / DDoS attack Detection

## Challenge1:
  Classification of executable file as benign/malware based on the static and dynamic analysis of the exe file using random forest classifier for training the model.
 
## Challenge2:
  Build a ddos detection tool to classify an input network traffic in pacap file as benign/DDOS affected. For training used a time series model and LSTM. Achieved best in class accuracy for the given dataset.
